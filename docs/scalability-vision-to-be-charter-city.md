# Scalability Vision of SubWork

Network states refer to the different conditions or stages that a network can be in. These states can include the initial setup, growth, maturity, and decline. In the context of startup cities, network states can refer to the different stages of development and growth that a city's startup ecosystem goes through.

Scalability vision for startup cities involves creating an environment that supports the growth and expansion of startups within a city. This can include developing infrastructure, providing access to funding and resources, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities, attracting talent and investors, and creating a supportive regulatory and policy framework.

Startup cities are a concept that refers to the development of new neighborhoods or cities that are specifically designed to foster and support the growth of startups. These cities provide an environment that encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration among startups. The idea behind startup cities is to create a space where startups can thrive by providing them with the necessary infrastructure, resources, and support systems.

Startup cities aim to attract and retain talented individuals, provide access to funding and investment opportunities, offer mentorship and networking programs, and create a supportive ecosystem for startups to grow and succeed. These cities often prioritize factors such as affordable office spaces, research and development facilities, access to technology and internet connectivity, and a favorable regulatory environment.

The concept of startup cities is still relatively new and evolving, and different projects in this field may have varying goals, motivations, and scopes. Some of the motivations behind startup cities can include economic opportunity, competitive governance, lifestyle, community building, and technological experimentation. Each project may have its unique characteristics and objectives based on these motivations.

It is important to note that startup cities are not limited to physical locations but can also refer to virtual or digital ecosystems that provide similar support and resources for startups. The goal is to create an environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship, enabling startups to thrive and contribute to economic growth and development.

For more in-depth information and analysis on startup cities, you can explore the Startup Cities platform, which discusses the technology behind cities, analyzes changes in cost structure and performance, and provides empirical skepticism about ambitious projects. Additionally, academic databases and research papers may also provide valuable insights into the concept of startup cities and their implementation strategies.

## Milestones

Planned milestones is to setup coliving with size up to 50 rooms. There are few few hotels around we can secure real estate positions.

Till then we reccomend to [setup people colivings on their own](./coliving-in-bled.md).


## Collaborative vision of SubWork

> I think that in the context of network state community mycelium infrastructure, it's best to view SubWork in Bled in two contexts:

> Where does SubWork come from:
> Historically, SubWork as a physical space as well as a bridge toward a metaphysical and digital space that empowers people it's an evolutionary continuation of its predecessor Progressbar in Bratislava.

> Where is SubWork headed?
> Future facing approach of any healthy mycelium and fungus organisms begets healthy collaboration with two layers:

> Underground: digitally via the cyberwilderness, using digital fungible assets for economic normal lubrication, NFTs as cultural experiences that mature and solidify into historic heritage and creative collaboration tools to facilitate coordination between particles in the organisms

> Above ground:

> For SubWork to emerge out of the spore into a network state mycelium, we should pursue a lean expansion mode where strategic locations provide resembling experience and coordinate with the original SubWork


What is ideal size?
---
Villages are too small, nations are too big. Cities are just right size. We envision attract approximatelly 10k right people to radius of SubWork


What we need to accomplish?
---
To make it work.

1. Good Rules - Charter
2. Choices for People - Uninhabited land
3. Choices for Leaders - Partnerships between nations

Terms of objects and motions
---
For quick transport, we already have airport 10 minutes away.
Living - Initial seed of 100 startup founders.
Expand coworking space - potential for acquistion whole shopping mall, should be enough for start
Opportunities for investors to make investments, i.e. build more robust infrastructure, grow consumer services, touristic offerings, accomodation &c so on
