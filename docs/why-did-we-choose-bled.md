# Why did we choose Bled for coworking space?
- has amazing medieval [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bled).
- there is superior **air-quality and nature equanimity** with lots of hike opportunities to close mountains around to faster recharge your mental wellbeing.
- lot of options of [sport activities to do](./sports-activities-around-bled.md)
- [yangwao](https://twitter.com/yangwao) been living in Bled since October 2021 and found it pretty well balanced place for wellbeing, with close reach to Ljubljana, Austrian Mountains, Italian Dolomites and sea side of Croatian Istrija.




who we are?

yangwao decided during early lockdown periods  to move somewhere where it's calm, beautiful nature and affordable life to cater needs of wellbeing. Pursuing superior air-quality in Julian Alps, close to 2500 annual sun hours, guarantee great mood even during winter which after experiencing cloudless winter it was go-to place and prefer stick with mountain rather seaside. Hospitality of local German-Slavics offered best from both, high morale and quality of delivery. With close access to capital Ljubljana under 30mins, 20min to Airport, under 2h to seaside is amazing choice place to be. Scenic place Bled offeres aesthetics with lake, church on Island in the middle and rock with medieval castle on the top with background of Karawanke two thousand high mountain top having snow even till late spring.

Removing city stimulus was one of key decision in choice of place as nowadays we spend great amount of screen time on telegram, discord, github and gpt prompts, where you would like to have instant access to nature under your finger once you finish your job and no need to rush to park in your city to relax.

Living here had transformative effect on all tenants of SubWork where they body and soul being upgraded to new athletic achievers, yangwao personally lost 10kg in 6 weeks just in snap and cured out from burn out. 

refreshing activities like meditation at lake, run up hill to enjoy views are underappreciated for creativity boost.

most important, no wonder it's touristic hotspot in Europe among campers as in surrounding there are lot of camp sites at beautiful white-blue river.


we are sort of perma crypto village like Davos or swiss city.

we appreciate effort of crypto popu-ups like Zuzalu, yet we are closer to concept of Creators Cabins. 

We are focus on creating value in middle of nowhere to remove city stimulus, let grow things which matters like body and mind which leads you to bigger crafts than one self
