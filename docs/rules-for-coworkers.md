# Offchain governance

As we are having _more than 8 members daily in space_, it's time to lay out basic rules to coordinate in space in positive way and being excellent to each other.



# Scarce resources
---
Conference room
---
Usage in straight supposed to be max 1hr as fair user policy for others taking calls. We have currently three places dedicated for your calls, big & small meeting room and micro booth. 

Toilet room
---
I would propose 3 minutes max rule and _best no phone_ üòÖ. 
Wifi works flawlessly outside of toilet and you may blocking someone who want to go on toilet üòâ

Having call?
---
Best to not distrub others is taking your calls from conference rooms. If they are full we recommend sit outside of silent zone and don't phone next someone else. If you decided to phone at tables, try to be silent üòå

Is someone loud to you?
--- 
Kindly ask them, if they can be silent for you. As SubWork is meant to be silent space aimed for productive mood and focus. Chit chats are more tolerated in afternoon hours like 3pm+ when deep work windows are mostly over people doesn't have headphones.

Kitchen
---
Leave it in place you want to find it again, it's simple. 

Glasses in space
---
Rule of thumb is to take glass with you after usage. Someone might forgot in hurry, so it's also good excellence to pick glasses after someone else. Next time it can happen to you and doing few more steps to kitchen helps your blood circulation and gain new perspective in life üôÉ

Headphones rule
---
Has someone headphones or earbuds? Probably best not to approach them or disturb them as they might being middle of their flow state.

Collaboration at family table
---
Our space is limited and as you are taking great time with team, we recommend you be bit silent during deep work hours even someone rolled out best joke of week. We've got it, there is never enough jokes.

Deep work hours window
--- 
Is usually between 10am-3pm. 

Want to shower?
---
Sure, reccomend is to bring your own towel as well as we don't offer for now ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Want to add something here?
---
