SubWork.xyz
===========

Co-work focused by Substrate Builders from **Polkadot inviting web3 builders.**

👨‍🏭 Who we are?
-----------------

We are **power builders from the Substrate ecosystem** - [KodaDot](https://twitter.com/kodadot).

We always wanted to have **space in nature away from everything.** Where others could come over to **re-charge and build their dream in peace** with like-minded athletic achievers.

We have focus on **web3 teams,** which are building in Polkadot ecosystem.

We will warmly welcome any web3 builders to hangout and share their insights in our **sunny royalcore styled lounge area with marble floor.**
